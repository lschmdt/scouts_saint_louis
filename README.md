# Business Jekyll Theme

Business Jekyll Theme is a theme that is designed to be used for small and medium business. It is designed by a team from [Technext](https://github.com/technext/). The theme is then ported over by [Melvin Ch'ng](http://melvinchng.github.io) for Jekyll support. The original source code can be obainted from Technext's [repository](https://github.com/technext/office)

Unlike most Jekyll Themes, Business Jekyll Theme is not meant to be a single page theme. This theme is a package that you can use for your business website or promote certain project. I reorganized all the files and make it Jekyll friendly.

Big thanks to the creator of Office as this theme would not be possible without their hard work! You are always welcome to contribute to this repository to make it better!
